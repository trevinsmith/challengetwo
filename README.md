# challengetwo
This is where I'm going to upload the challenge for section 2 for the UCLA Bootcamp. It's for the Advanced CSS section. The site will use grid, flexbox and animation. The site is intended to be a portfolio of my favorite work I've made in the class. I can't resist having a little fun with it re: the look.
